Sats Ketchup is the first food brand to pioneer a new way of doing business: decentralized, radically transparent, and collaborative. We believe transparency and decentralization are essential for creating lasting value. By using GitHub to openly share and document our journey, we are setting new precedents for how brands can operate.

We share our recipes, list our suppliers, and invite everyone to participate in our design and decision-making processes—redefining what a brand can be in the decentralized era. This is a work in progress, so not everything will be perfect from the start, but we are committed to continuous improvement.

While our core purpose drives us, we also recognize the importance of building a profitable business.

You are invited to follow our journey, ask questions, share feedback, and contribute your ideas—whether here on GitHub Discussions or through the links below.

## Why GitHub?

GitHub, while primarily designed for software, is currently the most accessible and widely used tool available to us. It effectively supports our goals of transparency and traceability. Until we find a more suitable platform, we will continue to use GitHub for this purpose.

### Pre-Launch Model

We consider this project to be in a pre-launch phase until we reach a certain amount of Core Contributors. During this phase, we are actively discussing and defining the brand and its models to support the decentralized growth of Sats Ketchup.

## Purpose and Profit

While our primary focus is purpose, we also aim to generate profit. Our goal is to establish a fair distribution model that empowers individuals and sustains the brand.
