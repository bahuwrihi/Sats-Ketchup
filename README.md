Sats Ketchup is the first food brand pioneering the decentralized brand economy — transparent, community-driven, and collaborative. We started this repository on GitHub to openly share and document the Sats brand’s journey and developments.

We believe that openness and transparency are key to the value creation of the future. We also recognize that this path is still largely uncharted and will set new precedents for how brands can operate. As such, this is a work in progress, and not everything will be perfect from the start.

We invite you to follow our journey, ask questions, share feedback, and contribute your ideas—whether here on GitHub Discussions or through the links provided below. Together, we invite you to help redefine what a brand can be in the decentralized era.

## Why GitHub?

GitHub, while primarily designed for software, is currently the most accessible and widely used tool available to us. It effectively supports our goals of transparency and traceability. Until we find a more suitable platform, we will continue to use GitHub for this purpose.

### Pre-Launch Model

We consider this project to be in a pre-launch phase until we reach a certain amount of Core Contributors. During this phase, we are actively discussing and defining the brand and its models to support the decentralized growth of Sats Ketchup.

## Purpose and Profit

While our primary focus is purpose, we also aim to generate profit. Our goal is to establish a fair distribution model that empowers individuals and sustains the brand.

Thank you for joining us in building a decentralized, transparent, and innovative food brand. Let’s reshape the future together!
