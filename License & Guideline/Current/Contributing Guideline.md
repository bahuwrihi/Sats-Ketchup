### Guideline

We invite every collaborator to act in accordance with our Key Principles, which are listed below. These principles shape our decisions as we build a brand that pioneers a new type of business model - one that reimagines how value is created, shared, and sustained in a connected world. Itâ€™s important to acknowledge that we are venturing into largely uncharted territory, and understand that building this new model is an ongoing process that will require flexibility, learning, and adaptation along the way. To support your journey, we encourage you to explore and contribute to our resources (link here).

# Key Principles

## 1. Decentralization as Empowerment  
We believe that a business thrives through decentralization. By embracing decentralized models (both digital and real-world) we empower individuals and communities to take responsibility and drive meaningful change.

## 2. Collaboration Fuels Success  
True progress comes from building collaborative ecosystems, not isolated silos. Working together across boundaries fuels innovation, shared success, and a stronger, more resilient network.

## 3. Quality, Fairness, and Regenerative Practices  
High quality and fair practices are non-negotiable. We commit to excellence and integrity, recognizing that our responsibility to future generations requires us to build regenerative systems that sustain people and the planet.

## 4. Sound Value Exchange  
We acknowledge that the current value exchange system has its flaws. To fundamentally change how we work and live together, we seek to create and operate within new forms of monetary and value exchange that foster wealth, abundance, and positive progress for all.

## 5. Accessibility and Openness  
We ensure open access and welcome all who wish to contribute. Sharing knowledge and processes openly builds trust, invites participation, and strengthens our community.

## 6. Humility, Integrity, and Anti-Corruption  
We strive to think beyond the ego, staying humble, open-minded, and positive. We remain vigilant against power plays, abuse, and corruption at every level, upholding incorruptibility and integrity as core values.
