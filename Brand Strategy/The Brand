## Our Guiding Values

### 1. Decentralization as Empowerment  
We believe that a business thrives through decentralization. By embracing decentralized models (both digital and real-world) we empower individuals and communities to take responsibility and drive meaningful change.

### 2. Collaboration Fuels Success  
True progress comes from building collaborative ecosystems, not isolated silos. Working together across boundaries fuels innovation, shared success, and a stronger, more resilient network.

### 3. Quality, Fairness, and Regenerative Practices  
High quality and fair practices are non-negotiable. We commit to excellence and integrity, recognizing that our responsibility to future generations requires us to build regenerative systems that sustain people and the planet.

### 4. Sound Value Exchange  
We acknowledge that the current value exchange system has its flaws. To fundamentally change how we work and live together, we seek to create and operate within new forms of monetary and value exchange that cultivates wealth and abundance for all.

### 5. Accessibility and Openness  
We ensure open access and welcome all who wish to contribute. Sharing knowledge and processes openly builds trust, invites participation, and strengthens our community.

### 6. Humility, Integrity, and Anti-Corruption  
We strive to think beyond the ego, staying humble, open-minded, and positive. We remain vigilant against power plays, abuse, and corruption at every level, upholding incorruptibility and integrity as core values.


## Why Ketchup?

Society advanced to what it is today because people developed complex ways to produce and distribute food. But food is more than just fuel or pleasure for our bodies — it connects us to nature, to each other, and to the moments that matter most in life. We chose ketchup because it is one of the most fundamental and universally loved food items—a staple in households around the world.

With Sats Ketchup, we see an opportunity to bring our message into everyday life. Our focus is on creating food that not only tastes superior but also nourishes the body, supports fair practices, and uses as many local products as possible. Every ingredient — sugar, vinegar, spices — is carefully selected to ensure the highest quality and integrity in every bottle.
