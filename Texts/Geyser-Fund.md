# Story

## Building the worldâ€™s first food brand for the decentralised era.

Sats Ketchup is here to prove that the time is ripe for a different kind of brand: a decentralised, fully transparent, and collaborative one.

The idea started to take shape during Bitcoin Pizza Day 2024. Driven by our passion for food and its ability to bring people together, we wanted to find a way to translate this energy into a real-world application. The potential of self-managed organisations inspired us to build SATS as a brand where we're experimenting with new ways of co-creating, co-organising, and co-owning. So, weâ€™ve chosen to openly document every step on GitHub and let the community take over ownership and decision-making in all areas.

Are we a non-profit? No. For us, real impact means building a business that's both profitable and purposeful.

## Why Ketchup?
We're starting with ketchup because it's a playful choice and a staple that everyone already knows, owns, and loves. There can't be a better way to bring the orange revolution into every household.

## Pre-Order Now
We're now opening pre-orders on our product page, where you can secure a bottle from our first batch and directly support our mission.

Your pre-order will help us finalise manufacturing partnerships in Canada and the EU, and while we're working out the details for chapters in other areas, pre-orders are open worldwide.

## Join Our Team
But that's not all! We're looking for passionate collaborators to join our team. Whether you're a designer, video creator, marketer, recipe developer, farmer or want to start a local production chapter, we want to hear from you! Check out our open Tasks on GitHub and become part of SATS.

# Our Guiding Principles
## Decentralisation as Empowerment
We believe that decentralisation is the future of business. We're pioneering a decentralised brand model that puts the community in control. Everyone has the opportunity to contribute: whether you're a Recipe Innovator developing new products, a Brand Storyteller creating engaging content, or a Community Organizer connecting us all.

## Collaboration Fuels Success
We believe that true progress comes from collaboration, not isolation. By working together openly and breaking down silos, we feed innovation and create shared success that is purposeful.

## Transparency and Openness
We believe that transparency is the foundation of trust. We demonstrate this by openly communicating and radically sharing knowledge and processes, including publishing our costs, recipes and all of our suppliers. Only transparency can rebuild the trust lost when brands sacrificed quality and value for fiat money.

## Quality, Fairness, and Regenerative Practices
High quality and fair practices are non-negotiable. We commit to quality and integrity, recognising that our responsibility to future generations requires us to build regenerative systems that sustain people and the planet.

## Sound Value Exchange
We recognise the flaws in our current monetary exchange system. To truly transform how we collaborate and create, weâ€™re committed to building and participating in solutions that reflect the values of sound money, generating wealth and abundance for everyone.

## Humility, Integrity, and Anti-Corruption
We make it our mission to think beyond the ego, stay humble, open-minded, and positive. We have zero tolerance for power plays, abuse, and corruption at any level, because incorruptibility and integrity are our core values.

# Product

**Sats All-Natural Ketchup is crafted in small batches from sun-ripened yellow Italian tomatoes, sweetened only with apple juice, and balanced with apple cider vinegar for a gentle, high-quality acidity. Our classic blend of herbs and spices delivers the familiar taste you love, but in a revolutionary new color.**

Weâ€™re the first food brand fully committed to decentralisation and radical transparency. Everything is openly shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/bahuwrihi/Sats-Ketchup/), where together we collaborate on every aspect of the brand.

Quality and fairness is at the core of what we do - from ingredient selection to fair pay for everyone involved.

Sats Ketchup comes in generous 470â€¯ml / 16â€¯fl oz glass bottles.

Weâ€™re focused on making Sats Ketchup available in the EU ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º and Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ first, with the USA and other countries to follow soon.

Join us on our journey, ask questions, and help shape the future of food.
