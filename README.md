## Why GitHub?
Our commitment to transparency means sharing everything, including:
- Team Members
- Budget
- Designs
- Ingredients
- Suppliers
- Marketing Strategies
- Work in Progress and more

Using GitHub allows us to track who is working on what, ensuring every step of our process is traceable. We strive to be 100% transparent, and while this repository remains private until launch, it will provide valuable insight into the project's development.

### Pre-Launch Model
During the pre-launch phase, we will discuss and define a model (and also a suitbale license) that supports decentralized growth. This system will allow for local replications or forks of the brand, ensuring that these adhere to the standards defined here.

## Purpose and Profit
While purpose is our primary focus, we will generate profit. We aim to establish a fair distribution model that empowers individuals and sustains the brand. The definition of "fair" is collaboratively developed within this GitHub repository. [link to the document]

## Onboarding Process
### How to Join:
There are currently two ways to onboard:

1. **As a Collaborator**:
   - If you're joining from Twitter, Nostr, or through friends, onboarding will be managed via our Matrix Channel or through Luca's Telegram. When you decide to contribute your time and become an active collaborator, you will gain access to this GitHub repository.

2. **As an Investor**:
   - For those who wish to support without contributing time, an investment option is available. This involves a fixed amount of **$21** or **21,000 Sats** deposited into the brand's account. After doing so you will get access to this Github repository.
   - A co-signed Dollar and Bitcoin account/wallet will be set up to gather these deposits. 

*Note: This investment fund will be managed according to rules established in this repository [link to the document].*
