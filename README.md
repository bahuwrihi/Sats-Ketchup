Sats Ketchup is setting a new standard for transparency and pioneering a decentralized brand ecosystem.
This repository is here to openly share and document the Sats brand’s journey and developments. Such transparent communication has not been seen before in the food industry, and we understand that taking this step brings added sensitivity around privacy. For this reason, some sections may not yet be fully published or may be redacted. This is a work in progress, and we welcome your questions, feedback, and ideas at any time.

**Important:** Access to this repository constitutes your explicit acceptance of the terms and conditions outlined in the documents found in the [License Folder](https://github.com/bahuwrihi/Sats-Ketchup/tree/807ae7e54d1e9b974d9f4c50970269568f528bfd/License%20%26%20Guideline/Current).

## Why GitHub?

GitHub, while primarily designed for software, is currently the most accessible and widely used tool available to us. It effectively supports our goals of transparency and traceability. Until we find a more suitable platform, we will continue to use GitHub for this purpose.

### Pre-Launch Model

We consider this project to be in a pre-launch phase until we reach a certain amount of Core Contributors. During this phase, we are actively discussing and defining the brand and its models to support the decentralized growth of Sats Ketchup.

## Purpose and Profit

While our primary focus is purpose, we also aim to generate profit. Our goal is to establish a fair distribution model that empowers individuals and sustains the brand.
