## Our Guiding Values

### 1. Decentralization as Empowerment  
We believe that decentralisation is the future of business. We're pioneering a decentralised brand model that puts the community in control. Everyone has the opportunity to contribute: whether you're a Recipe Innovator developing new products, a Brand Storyteller creating engaging content, or a Community Organizer connecting us all.

### 2. Collaboration Fuels Success  
We believe that true progress comes from collaboration, not isolation. By working together openly and breaking down silos, we feed innovation and create shared success that is purposeful.

### 3. Transparency and Openness  
We believe that transparency is the foundation of trust. We demonstrate this by openly communicating and radically sharing knowledge and processes, including publishing our costs, recipes and all of our suppliers. Only transparency can rebuild the trust lost when brands sacrificed quality and value for fiat money.

### 4. Quality, Fairness, and Regenerative Practices
High quality and fair practices are non-negotiable. We commit to quality and integrity, recognising that our responsibility to future generations requires us to build regenerative systems that sustain people and the planet.

### 5. Sound Value Exchange  
We recognise the flaws in our current monetary exchange system. To truly transform how we collaborate and create, we’re committed to building and participating in solutions that reflect the values of sound money, generating wealth and abundance for everyone.

### 6. Humility, Integrity, and Anti-Corruption  
We make it our mission to think beyond the ego, stay humble, open-minded, and positive. We have zero tolerance for power plays, abuse, and corruption at any level, because incorruptibility and integrity are our core values..


## Why Ketchup?

Society advanced to what it is today because people developed complex ways to produce and distribute food. But food is more than just fuel or pleasure for our bodies — it connects us to nature, to each other, and to the moments that matter most in life. We chose ketchup because it is one of the most fundamental and universally loved food items—a staple in households around the world.

With Sats Ketchup, we see an opportunity to bring our message into everyday life. Our focus is on creating food that not only tastes superior but also nourishes the body, supports fair practices, and uses as many local products as possible. Every ingredient — sugar, vinegar, spices — is carefully selected to ensure the highest quality and integrity in every bottle.
