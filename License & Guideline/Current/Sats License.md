# SATS-KETCHUP INTERIM LICENSE

_Last updated: 02.05.2025_

---

## Preamble

Sats-Ketchup is pioneering a new, decentralized brand model. As we build our community and define our values, we are also developing a licensing framework that will balance openness, collaboration, and brand integrity. This interim license protects our work and community while we work toward a custom license - likely inspired by the Cryptographic Autonomy License (CAL) and other open models - that will better serve our global and local contributors. Your feedback is welcome as we shape this together.
