# Compliance Documentation for our Glass Bottles: Overview and Requirements

## Introduction
This document provides an overview (as of October 2024) of the compliance requirements for glass bottles that we intend to use for packaging our ketchup/sauce. Whether we import these glass bottles or produce them locally in the markets we plan to enter (EU - Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic, USA, and Canada), it is crucial to ensure that they meet the regulatory standards for food contact materials in each region.

Our goal is to source a single type of glass bottle that looks the same across all marketsâ€”Europe, the USA, and Canada. Ideally, this bottle will be certified for all regions to simplify compliance and production. Below is a summary of the minimum certifications and documentation required, followed by a more detailed breakdown by region.

## Key Compliance Documents for All Markets
To streamline the process across all markets, the following core documents should be provided by the manufacturer, ensuring the glass bottle meets regulations for food contact materials:

- **Declaration of Compliance (DoC):**
  - A compliance statement that confirms the glass + lid adheres to both **EU (EC) No. 1935/2004** and **FDA (21 CFR 177)** regulations.

- **Migration Test Results:**
  - A report showing the glass container and the lid is safe for food contact and does not leach harmful substances under typical use conditions, covering both EU and FDA standards.

- **Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Statement:**
  - Confirmation that the glass and the lid was produced under GMP standards, as required for all markets (EU, USA, and Canada).

- **Traceability Documentation:**
  - A statement confirming traceability measures are in place throughout production and distribution, as required by EU and other regions.

## Detailed Compliance Requirements by Region

### 1. Europe (EU)
**Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004** governs food contact materials in the EU. To comply with these regulations, the following documentation is required:

- **Declaration of Compliance (DoC):**
  - Confirms the glass container and the lid complies with **(EC) No. 1935/2004** and any applicable national regulations. It must include:
    - Manufacturer's identity.
    - Material details and intended food contact use.
    - Statement confirming compliance with EC requirements.
    - Migration test results or a reference to the tests.
    - Information on traceability.

- **Migration Testing Reports:**
  - Test results proving the glass + lid does not transfer harmful substances to food. These results are often part of the DoC.

- **GMP Documentation:**
  - A statement or certificate confirming the product is manufactured according to **Regulation (EC) No. 2023/2006** on GMP.

- **Traceability Documentation:**
  - Confirmation that all production stages are traceable, as per **Article 17** of **(EC) No. 1935/2004**.

### 2. Germany
In addition to **(EC) No. 1935/2004**, Germany follows **BfR Recommendation XV** for glassware intended for food contact. This is a **voluntary recommendation** providing stricter guidance on materials and limits for certain substances. While not legally binding, it may become relevant as we grow. For now, it is not a priority but should be considered for future market expansion.

### 3. USA
In the USA, glass containers + lid for food contact are regulated under the **Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)** by the **FDA**. Key documents required include:

- **FDA Compliance Statement:**
  - A certificate confirming the glass container + lid meets FDA food contact regulations under **21 CFR 177**.

- **Migration Testing Results:**
  - Test reports showing the glass + lid does not leach harmful substances into food, confirming compliance with **FDA migration limits**.

- **GMP Compliance:**
  - A statement confirming the glass + lid was produced under GMP regulations in accordance with **21 CFR 110**.

- **Food Contact Substance Notification (FCN):**
  - This is required only if the glass + lid contains new materials or coatings not covered by FDA regulations. Standard glass usually does not require this.

### 4. Canada
**Health Canada** generally aligns its food contact material regulations with **FDA standards**. Therefore, **FDA documentation** can often be used to demonstrate compliance in Canada.

- **Health Canada Compliance:**
  - Use the **FDA compliance documentation**, including migration test results and GMP statements, to demonstrate compliance with Health Canada's guidelines for food contact materials.

## General Guidelines for Handling Compliance Documents

### 1. Customs and Regulatory Requirements

- **Customs Inspections:**
  - Customs authorities in the **EU**, **USA**, and **Canada** may request documentation during the import process, but they typically do not demand it unless there's an inspection or specific issue.
  - **What to Do:** Keep the documents (DoC, migration test results, GMP statement) readily available for inspection, but you do not need to submit them proactively.

### 2. Proactive Submission to Authorities

- **No Proactive Submission:**
  - You are generally not required to submit your compliance documentation to authorities such as **Health Canada** or the **FDA** unless requested during an audit, inspection, or investigation.
  - Most countries operate on a **self-certification system**. This means you only need to provide the documents upon request.

### 3. Steps for Compliance

- **In Canada:** Retain the **FDA documentation** on file. If requested, provide the documents to **Health Canada** or **customs**.
  
- **In the USA:** Keep the **FDA compliance documents** ready for any inspections by **FDA** or **customs**.

- **In the EU:** Ensure the **Declaration of Compliance (DoC)** and related documents are up to date and ready for inspection. No need to file them with authorities beforehand.

### 4. Ongoing Compliance

- Keep the compliance documents on file and updated. If there are changes to the product (e.g., glass formulation), you will need to update the **migration test results** and compliance documents.
- Be prepared to show the documents to retailers, distributors, or buyers who may ask for proof of compliance.

## Conclusion
By sourcing a single glass bottle + lid that complies with **FDA** and **EU regulations**, we simplify the compliance process across multiple markets. Keeping these documents on file and readily accessible will ensure smooth customs clearance and compliance with regulatory inspections.
